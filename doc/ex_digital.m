%% Digital Control Design
%%
% In this example we will attempt to design a digital feedback controller for our
% <matlab:web('example.html') basic SISO example>. We quickly compute the
% plant, the templates and the bounds as follows:
%%
% % 
    % plant
    k=qpar('k',2,2,5,8);
    a=qpar('a',3,1,3,8);
    z=qpar('z',0.6,0.3,0.6,8);
    wn=qpar('wn',4,4,8,8);
    num = [qrff('hf',a) qrff('gain',k)];
    den = qrff('dc',wn,z);
    P = qplant(num,den);
    % templates
    w = [0.2 0.5 1 2 3 5 7 10 20 50];
    w_nom = logspace(-2,2.2,300);  
    P.cnom(w_nom);
    P.ctpl('rff',w,'accuracy',[0.25 1])
    % specifications
    spec1 = qspc('odsrs',w,6);
    spec2 = qspc.rsrs([1.2 0.2],10,1.5,[],logspace(-1,2),2.85,3.1);
    des = qdesign(P,[spec1 spec2]);
    % bounds
    des.cbnd('odsrs');
    des.cbnd('rsrs');

% Assume that a digital controller with sampling period $T_s = 0.02$ seconds is to be used, i.e.
% the sampling frequency is $f_s = 50$ [Hz] or $\omega_s = 100\pi$ [rad/s] $\approx 314$ [rad/s]. 
% Therefore an analog anti-aliasing pre-sampling filter, $A(s)$,  with a bandwidth of 100 [rad/s], 
% is introduced as part of the controller transfer function. We choose
% 
% $$A(s) = \frac{1}{1 + 2\cdot 0.7 \cdot s/100 + s^2 / 10000}.$$
% 
% The sampling and hold operation of the digital feedback compensator has 
% the analog transfer function
%
% $$H(s) = \frac{1-e^{-T_s s}}{T_s s},$$
%
% which can be realized in series with the anti-aliasing filter using the 
% Control System Toolbox as follows

Ts = 0.02;
s = tf('s');
A = 1/(1+2*0.7/100*s+s^2/100^2);
H = (1-exp(-Ts*s))/Ts/s;
HA = H*A;
bode(HA,logspace(-1,log10(50*pi))); % plot up to Nyquist frequency

%%
% Now comes the stage to design the digital feedback compensator pulse transfer 
% function as a function of $z$. With $z = e^{s T_s}$ one gets its frequency 
% function. It is of course possible to design directly in the $z$-domain, 
% However we choose the, often more convenient, $s$-domain design followed by 
% translation to the $z$-domain. 
% We recommend the so called modal or matched pole-zero translation implemented 
% in the Control System Toolbox command |c2d| with the |'matched'|.

%%
% Our first design attempt will be a modal translation of the analog compensator 
%
% $$ C(s) = \frac{2.5(1+1.2s/4+s^2/16)}{s(1+s/3.2)}. $$
% 
% The Nichols nominal open-loop response $L=P(s)C(z)H(s)A(s)$ is computed
% as

Cs = 2.5*(1+1.2*s/4+s^2/16)/s/(1+s/3.2);
Cz = c2d(Cs,Ts,'matched');
%%
Cfr = qfr(Cz,w_nom);    % get open Qsyn frequency response element
CHA = series(Cfr,HA);   % add the filter and the sampler

h = des.showbnd('odsrs',[],[2 3 5 7 10 20 50]); % show sensitivity bounds 
des.showbnd('rsrs',h,[0.2 0.5 1]); % show servo bounds
des.loopnic(CHA) % plot L on NC 
ngrid

%%
% The result is not that impressive: another lag, seems to be necessary, and we
% try again with 
%
% $$ C_2(s) = \frac{2.5(1+s/5)(1+1.2s/4+s^2/16)}{s(1+s)(1+s/3.2)},$$
%
% which is realized with aid of the Control System toolbox as 

C2s = 2*(1+s/5)*(1+1.2*s/4+s^2/16)/s/(1+s)/(1+s/3.2);
C2z = c2d(C2s,Ts,'matched');
C2fr = qfr(C2z,w_nom);    % get open Qsyn frequency response element
C2HA = series(C2fr,HA);

h2 = des.showbnd('odsrs',[],[2 3 5 7 10 20 50]); % show sensitivity bounds 
des.showbnd('rsrs',h2,[0.2 0.5 1]); % show servo bounds
des.loopnic(C2HA) % plot L on NC 
ngrid

%%
% For the digital prefilter design, it is not necessary to include a presamplingfilter,
% and a sampling and hold device, since the reference signal is generated in the 
% computer, or received as a sampled signal.
