%% PID controller
% A proportional-integral-derivative is a control loop mechanism which 
% continuously calculates an error value (the difference between a reference
% signal and feedback from the output) and applies correction based on its
% PID terms.
%
% This submenu enables the user to choose the controller terms, and see its
% magnitude and phase via bode plot. Once the user is satisfied with the 
% result, the save & exit button can be pressed. Doing so concatenates the
% PID controller inside the QFT controller.
