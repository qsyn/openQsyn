%% Lead
% Lead compensator is used to add phase to the open loop,
% but using it will increase the gain at high frequencies.
%
% This submenu enables the user to choose the desired gain increase at a 
% given frequency, and see the resulted magnitude and phase of the compensator
% via bode plot. Once the user is satisfied with the result, the save & exit
% button can be pressed. Doing so concatenates the lead compensator inside 
% the QFT controller.
